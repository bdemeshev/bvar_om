  Abstract                 = { This paper analyzes the forecasting performance of an open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, estimated with Bayesian methods, for the Euro area during 1994Q1-2002Q4. We compare the DSGE model and a few variants of this model to various reduced-form forecasting models such as vector autoregressions (VARs) and vector error correction models (VECM), estimated both by maximum likelihood and two different Bayesian approaches, and traditional benchmark models, e.g., the random walk. The accuracy of point forecasts, interval forecasts and the predictive distribution as a whole are assessed in an out-of-sample rolling event evaluation using several univariate and multivariate measures. The results show that the open economy DSGE model compares well with more empirical models and thus that the tension between rigor and fit in older generations of DSGE models is no longer present. We also critically examine the role of Bayesian model probabilities and other frequently used low-dimensional summaries, e.g., the log determinant statistic, as measures of overall forecasting performance.},

It thus covers a broad range of rather recent models for economic time series, such as non linear models, autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic regressions, and cointegrated vector autoregressive models. It contains also an extensive chapter on unit root inference from the Bayesian viewpoint. Several examples illustrate the methods.}

A higher oil price not only leads to higher economic growth and savings in the sovereign wealth fund, but also induces a rupture in the Russian economy. Public spending and household spending increase while the traditional export industries suffer from real appreciation, in line with the Dutch disease hypothesis. We also show that alternative policies for spending of the petroleum income may have considerable consequences for economic growth, the degree of crowding out of traditional export industries and wealth accumulation in the fund.},

  Abstract                 = { Structural vector autoregressions (VARs) are widely used to trace out the effect of monetary policy innovations on the economy. However, the sparse information sets typically used in these empirical models lead to at least three potential problems with the results. First, to the extent that central banks and the private sector have information not reflected in the VAR, the measurement of policy innovations is likely to be contaminated. Second, the choice of a specific data series to represent a general economic concept such as "real activity" is often arbitrary to some degree. Third, impulse responses can be observed only for the included variables, which generally constitute only a small subset of the variables that the researcher and policy-maker care about. In this paper we investigate one potential solution to this limited information problem, which combines the standard structural VAR analysis with recent developments in factor analysis for large data sets. We find that the information that our factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) methodology exploits is indeed important to properly identify the monetary transmission mechanism. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive and coherent picture of the effect of monetary policy on the economy. © 2005 MIT Press},

The handbook assumes that readers have a fair grasp of basic classical econometrics (e.g. maximum likelihood estimation). It is recommended that readers familiarise themselves with Matlab© programming language to derive the maximum benefit from this handbook. A basic guide to Matlab© is attached at the end of the handbook. The first chapter of the handbook introduces basic concepts of Bayesian analysis. In particular, the chapter focuses on the technique of Gibbs sampling and applies it to a linear regression model. The chapter shows how to code this algorithm via several practical examples. The second chapter introduces Bayesian vector autoregressions (VARs) and discusses how Gibbs sampling can be used for these models. The third chapter shows how Gibbs sampling can be applied to popular econometric models such as time-varying VARs and dynamic factor models. The final chapter introduces the Metropolis Hastings algorithm. We intend to introduce new topics in revised versions of this handbook on a regular basis. The handbook comes with a set of Matlab© codes that can be used to replicate the examples in each chapter. The code (provided in code.zip) is organised by chapter. For example, the folder 'Chapter 1' contains all the examples referred to in the first chapter of this handbook. The views expressed in this handbook are those of the authors, and not necessarily those of the Bank of England. The reference material and computer codes are provided without any guarantee of accuracy.},

In particular, we use a large Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) with an optimal amount of shrinkage towards univariate AR models. The optimal shrinkage is chosen by maximizing the Marginal Likelihood of the model. Focusing on the US, we provide an extensive study on the forecasting performance of the proposed model relative to most of the existing alternative specifications. While most of the existing evidence focuses on statistical measures of forecast accuracy, we also consider alternative measures based on trading schemes and portfolio allocation. We extensively check the robustness of our results, using different datasets and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the proposed BVAR approach produces competitive forecasts, systematically more accurate than random walk forecasts, even though the gains are small.},

We argue that this question is interesting because it lies at the center of a particular approach to assessing the empirical plausibility of structural economic models that can be used to think about systematic changes in monetary policy institutions and rules.The literature has not yet converged on a particular set of assumptions for identifying the effects of an exogenous shock to monetary policy. Nevertheless, there is considerable agreement about the qualitative effects of a monetary policy shock in the sense that inference is robust across a large subset of the identification schemes that have been considered in the literature. We document the nature of this agreement as it pertains to key economic aggregates.},

We focus on the estimation of their predictive distributions, with special attention being paid to the mean and the covariance matrix of h-step ahead forecasts. In the empirical analysis, we examine the forecasting performance of the New Area-Wide Model (NAWM) that has been designed for use in the macroeconomic projections at the European Central Bank. The forecast sample covers the period following the introduction of the euro and the out-of-sample performance of the NAWM is compared to nonstructural benchmarks, such as Bayesian vector autoregressions (BVARs). Overall, the empirical evidence indicates that the NAWM compares quite well with the reduced-form models and the results are therefore in line with previous studies. Yet there is scope for improving the NAWM’s forecasting performance. For example, the model is not able to explain the moderation in wage growth over the forecast evaluation period and, therefore, it tends to overestimate nominal wages. As a consequence, both the multivariate point and density forecasts using the log determinant and the log predictive score, respectively, suggest that a large BVAR can outperform the NAWM.

By modelling prices together with real activity, employment and wages, we can disentangle the role of unit labour costs and profit margins as the factors affecting price pressures on the supply side. In out-of-sample forecast exercises, the PVAR model fares comparatively well against common alternatives, although short-horizon forecast errors tend to be large when we consider only the period of the recent financial crisis. The second part of the paper focuses on Spain, for which prediction errors during the crisis are particularly large. Given that its economy faced dramatic sectoral changes due to the burst of a housing bubble, we use the PVAR model for studying the transmission of shocks originating from the Spanish construction sector to other sectors. In a multi-country extension of the model, we also allow for spillovers to the other euro area countries in our sample. JEL Classification: C33, C53, E31, E37},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a multi-sector New Keynesian model of a small open economy that includes commodity, manufacturing, non-tradable, and import sectors. Price and wage rigidities are sector specific, modelled à la Calvo-Yun style contracts. Labour and capital are imperfectly mobile across sectors. Commodities, whose prices are exogenously set in world markets and denominated in a foreign currency, are divided between exports and home uses as direct inputs in production of manufactured and non-tradable goods. Structural parameters of monetary policy, wage and price rigidities, capital adjustment costs, and exogenous process shocks are econometrically estimated using Canadian and U.S. data for the period 1981–2005 and a maximum likelihood procedure. The estimates indicate significant heterogeneity across sectors. The model is then simulated to evaluate the effects of commodity price shocks on real exchange rate variability and to measure their welfare implications, by conducting welfare analysis employing a second-order solution method. The main results show that commodity price shocks, which are shocks to the terms of trade, significantly contribute to exchange rate fluctuations and business cycles in the small open economy. Moreover, because of different non-linearities in the model, fluctuating commodity prices lead to welfare gains when adopting a flexible exchange rate regime. This regime is also required to improve welfare gains and to offset negative effects of other domestic and foreign shocks.},

However, if a model suite is populated with many similar models, then the weight attached to other independent models may be lower than warranted by their performance. One way to mitigate this problem is to group similar models into distinct `ensembles'. Using the original suite of models in Norges Bank's system for averaging models (SAM), we evaluate whether forecast performance can be improved by combining ensemble densities, rather than combining individual model densities directly. We evaluate performance both in terms of point forecasts and density forecasts, and test whether the densities are well-calibrated. We find encouraging results for combining ensembles.},

  Abstract                 = {A common practice in macroeconomics is to assess the validity of general equilibrium models by first deriving their implications for population moments and then comparing population moments with observed sample moments. Generally the population moments are not explicit functions of model parameters, and so computational experiments are used to establish the link between parameters and moments. In most cases the general equilibrium models are intended to describe certain population moments (for example, means) but not others (for example, variances). The comparison of population moments with observed sample moments is informal, a process that has been termed calibration by some economists and ocular econometrics by others. This paper provides a formal probability framework within which this approach to inference can be studied. There are two principle results. First, if general equilibrium models are taken as predictive for sample moments, then the formal econometrics of model evaluation and comparison are straightforward. The fact that the models describe only a subset of moments presents no obstacles, and the formal econometrics yield as a byproduct substantial insights into the workings of models. Second, if general equilibrium models are taken to establish implications for population moments but not sample moments, then there is no link to reality because population moments are unobserved. Under this assumption, atheoretical macroeconomic models that link population and sample moments can be introduced coherently into the formal econometrics of model evaluation and comparison. The result is a framework that unifies general equilibrium models (theory without measurement) and atheoretical econometrics (measurement without theory). The paper illustrates these using some models of the equity premium.},

Relative to the existing literature (Diebold and Mariano (1995) and West (1996)), we introduce two main innovations: (i) We derive our tests in an environment where the finite sample properties of the estimators on which the forecasts may depend are preserved asymptotically. (ii) We accommodate conditional evaluation objectives (can we predict which forecast will be more accurate at a future date?), which nest unconditional objectives (which forecast was more accurate on average?), that have been the sole focus of previous literature. As a result of (i), our tests have several advantages: they capture the effect of estimation uncertainty on relative forecast performance, they can handle forecasts based on both nested and nonnested models, they allow the forecasts to be produced by general estimation methods, and they are easy to compute. Although both unconditional and conditional approaches are informative, conditioning can help fine-tune the forecast selection to current economic conditions. To this end, we propose a two-step decision rule that uses current information to select the best forecast for the future date of interest. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by comparing forecasts from leading parameter-reduction methods for macroeconomic forecasting using a large number of predictors.

  Abstract                 = {Vector autoregressions (VARs) are flexible time series models that can capture complex dynamic interrelationships among macroeconomic variables. However, their dense parameterization leads to unstable inference and inaccurate out-of-sample forecasts, particularly for models with many variables. A solution to this problem is to use informative priors in order to shrink the richly parameterized unrestricted model toward a parsimonious naÄ±ve benchmark, and thus reduce estimation uncertainty. This paper studies the optimal choice of the informativeness of these priors, which we treat as additional parameters, in the spirit of hierarchical modeling. This approach, theoretically grounded and easy to implement, greatly reduces the number and importance of subjective choices in the setting of the prior. Moreover, it performs very well in terms of both out-of-sample forecastingâ€”as well as factor modelsâ€”and accuracy in the estimation of impulse response functions.

We propose a diagnostic approach to the evaluation of predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of "maximizing the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration". Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predictions and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration. We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness, among them the probability integral transform histogram, marginal calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules. The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking of probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy centre in the US Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general, nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for model diagnostics and model selection.

We apply this methodology to the modeling of a multivariate system by specifying the dynamics of the marginal distributions of each process in the system, together with a copula that ties up the marginals to produce their multivariate distribution. We work with the probability integral transforms (PIT) of the system that, under a correct specification of the conditional model, should be i.i.d. U[0,1]. The dimensionality of the system is not a constraint, because the information contained in the vector of PITs is condensed into an indicator, which is the basis of the proposed tests. We construct hyper-cubes of different sizes within the maximum hyper-cube formed by a multidimensional uniform density [0,1]n, and assess the locations of the empirical PITs (duplex, triplex, n-plex of observations) within the corresponding population hyper-cubes. If the conditional model is correct, the volumes of the population hyper-cubes must be the same as those in their empirical counterparts. This approach allows the researcher to focus on different areas of the conditional density model, so as to assess the regions of interest. We estimate a trivariate model for a very large number of trades on the stocks of three large U.S. banks and find that the contemporaneous dependence among institutions is asymmetric, which implies that when liquidity drains (due to a lack of trading) in one institution, we should expect a concurrent effect among similar institutions. On the other hand, when liquidity is plentiful (due to dense trading), the trades on the stocks of the institutions are not correlated. We assess the models’ performances by evaluating their one-step-ahead density forecasts of trades.},

  Abstract                 = {Macroeconomic practitioners frequently work with multivariate time series models such as VARs, factor augmented VARs as well as time-varying parameter versions of these models (including variants with multivariate stochastic volatility). These models have a large number of parameters and, thus, over-parameterization problems may arise. Bayesian methods have become increasingly popular as a way of overcoming these problems. In this monograph, we discuss VARs, factor augmented VARs and time-varying parameter extensions and show how Bayesian inference proceeds. Apart from the simplest of VARs, Bayesian inference requires the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods developed for state space models and we describe these algorithms. The focus is on the empirical macroeconomist and we offer advice on how to use these models and methods in practice and include empirical illustrations. A website provides Matlab code for carrying out Bayesian inference in these models.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper considers the problem of forecasting in dynamic factor models using Bayesian model averaging. Theoretical justifications for averaging across models, as opposed to selecting a single model, are given. Practical methods for implementing Bayesian model averaging with factor models are described. These methods involve algorithms which simulate from the space defined by all possible models. We discuss how these simulation algorithms can also be used to select the model with the highest marginal likelihood (or highest value of an information criterion) in an efficient manner. We apply these methods to the problem of forecasting GDP and inflation using quarterly U.S. data on 162 time series. For both GDP and inflation, we find that the models which contain factors do out-forecast an AR(p), but only by a relatively small amount and only at short horizons. We attribute these findings to the presence of structural instability and the fact that lags of dependent variable seem to contain most of the information relevant for forecasting. Relative to the small forecasting gains provided by including factors, the gains provided by using Bayesian model averaging over forecasting methods based on a single model are appreciable.

In addition, we highlight that external wealth' plays a critical role in determining the behavior of the trade balance, both through shifts in the desired net foreign asset position and the investment returns generated on the outstanding stock of net foreign assets. Finally, we provide some evidence that a portfolio balance effect exists: real interest rate differentials are inversely related to net foreign asset positions.},

  Abstract                 = {There are large differences between the microeconometeric estimates of the Frisch labor supply elasticity (0-0.5) and the values used by macroeconomists to calibrate general equilibrium models (2-4). The microeconometric estimates of the Frisch are typically estimated by regressing changes in hours on changes in wages conditional on the individual being a married male head of household, working some minimum number of hours and being of prime working age. In contrast macroeconomic calibration values are typically set such that fluctuations in a general equilibrium model match the observed changes in the aggregate hours and wages from the whole population over time. This paper aims to explain the gap by estimating an aggregate Frisch elasticity which is consistent with the concept of macro calibration values using the microeconometric techniques. In order to estimate the Frisch consistent with the macro concept, this paper alters the typical microeconometric approach in order to incorporate fluctuations on the extensive margin and also broadens the scope of the sample to include single males, females, secondary earners, young individuals, and old individuals. This paper finds that estimates of the aggregate macro Frisch elasticity are in the middle of the range of macroeconomic calibration values (around 3.0). Furthermore, it finds that the key to explaining the difference are the fluctuations on the extensive margin of single males, females, secondary earners, older individuals, and younger individuals.},

Structural VAR identification based on timing restrictions, long run restrictions, and restrictions on factor loadings are discussed and practical computational methods suggested. Empirical analysis using U.S. data suggest several (7) dynamic factors, rejection of the exact dynamic factor model but support for an approximate factor model, and sensible results for a SVAR that identifies money policy shocks using timing restrictions.},

Our empirical results indicate that the Russian monetary policy follows a nonlinear interest rate rule. Further, we clarify the preference of the monetary policy in subsample estimation. When the 1998 financial crisis is considered, Russia.s preference for output expansion is evident. According to Surico, this increases inflation in Russia.},

It covers the basic theoretical approaches, shows how to do simulation work with the models, and discusses the full range of frictions that economists have studied to understand the impacts of monetary policy. Among the topics presented are money-in-the-utility function, cash-in-advance, and search models of money; informational, portfolio, and nominal rigidities; credit frictions; the open economy; and issues of monetary policy, including discretion and commitment, policy analysis in new Keynesian models, and monetary operating procedures. The use of models based on dynamic optimization and nominal rigidities in consistent general equilibrium frameworks, relatively new when introduced to students in the first edition of this popular text, has since become the method of choice of monetary policy analysis. This third edition reflects the latest advances in the field, incorporating new or expanded material on such topics as monetary search equilibria, sticky information, adaptive learning, state-contingent pricing models, and channel systems for implementing monetary policy. Much of the material on policy analysis has been reorganized to reflect the dominance of the new Keynesian approach. Monetary Theory and Policy continues to be the only comprehensive and up-to-date treatment of monetary economics, not only the leading text in the field but also the standard reference for academics and central bank researchers.},

  Abstract                 = { Recent empirical work has considered the prediction of inflation by combining the information in a large number of time series. One such method that has been found to give consistently good results consists of simple equal-weighted averaging of the forecasts from a large number of different models, each of which is a linear regression relating inflation to a single predictor and a lagged dependent variable. In this paper, I consider using Bayesian model averaging for pseudo out-of-sample prediction of US inflation, and find that it generally gives more accurate forecasts than simple equal-weighted averaging. This superior performance is consistent across subsamples and a number of inflation measures. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
